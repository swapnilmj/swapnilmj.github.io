      <description>I feel there is more to being a good software enginner than knowing the programming language (and DB/UI) alone. The other ones being (in no particular order):
Thinking in abstractions. Finding patterns. Taking a step backwards and looking at the bigger picture. Clarity of thought. Knowing the business purpose of the feature/change request. Good written communication. Knowing the developer tools well. Using the (right) developer tools. Curiosity. Identifying what assumptions to verify (specially while debugging).</description>
